            <h2>Repulsor Rays</h2>
            <p>Located in the palms of the Iron Man armor, the repulsor rays are Iron Man's go-to weapon. They draw power from the suit's reactor and can be used as weapons or for flight stability and guidance.</p>
            
            <h2>Unibeam</h2>
            <p>Similar to the repulsor rays, the unibeam is a powerful searchlight, capable of projecting beams in virtually every light spectrum. Also, it can be used as a powerful weapon that can destroy anything in its path.</p>

            <h2>Armor Capabilities</h2>
            <p>The Iron Man armor offers a variety of abilities including super strength, flight, and an array of weapons. The suit is also fully equipped with global positioning systems, radar systems, multiple onboard computers and communication systems, biological, chemical and radiation detectors, and the infamous arc reactor technology that keeps Tony Stark alive.</p>

            <h2>J.A.R.V.I.S.</h2>
            <p>J.A.R.V.I.S. (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System) is an artificial intelligence that assists Tony Stark and manages the functions of his residence and the Iron Man armors.</p>
